__Trivial Freezer__ allows admins of GNU/Linux systems to take snapshoots of user files and configurations. Snapshoots can be automatically restored at next session start, thus "freezing" user settings between sessions.

It is specially  suitable for public computers in schools, where multiple real users share few system ids.
