__Trivial Freezer__ allows system admins of GNU/Linux systems to take snapshoots of user files and configurations. Snapshoots can be automatically restored at next session start, thus "freezing" user settings between sessions.

It's specially indicated for public computers in schools, wher multiple real users share a common system id.
